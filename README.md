# Depth-Estimation from stereo images using Census Transform and Hamming distance

You are given the left and the right rectified stereo images and you have to create the disparity map. The images must be transformed using Census transform and compared each other using Hamming distance. The results of the comparison represents the result of the depth estimation algorithm.
Steps of doing this project:

1. Census transform on the left and right perspective image
2. Hamming distance on the resulted census transform
3. Make the disaprity
